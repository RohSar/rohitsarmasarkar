              Hi, I'm Rohit and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, India. I completed my PhD as a Prime Minister's Research Fellow (PMRF) under the supervision of Dr. Bodhayan Roy, from the Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My research interest lie in the area of quantum computing, quantum circuits, quantum information, linear algebra and quantum walks. My thesis is titled Scalable quantum circuit representation of unitary 
              matrices. Here is my <a href="CVDECRohit.pdf">CV</a>.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
              In my PhD tenure, we developed scalable quantum circuits for unitary matrices that describe the evolution of many-body quantum systems. Specifically, we proposed a quantum neural network-based framework to approximate any target unitary for n-qubit systems, and we established a circuit representation for the exponential of scaled Pauli strings which we used to propose scalable quantum circuit simulations of various Hamiltonians on near-term quantum devices. Furthermore, we analyzed several fundamental properties of diverse classes of discrete-time quantum walk models on various graphs using parametric coins which were introduced by us. For discrete-time three state quantum walks on Cayley graphs, we additionally proposed a scalable quantum circuit model using elementary qutrit gates. We explored the circuit complexity of the proposed quantum circuit models, and incorporated various noise models in our circuits to investigate the performance of the proposed circuit simulations on near-term quantum computers. Here, scalable quantum circuit means that it is possible to construct a quantum circuit for (n+1)-qubit system from a quantum circuit on n-qubit system using additional elementary quantum gates.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we developed a parametric representation of unitary matrices of dimension d with the introduction of a new unitary Hermitian basis for the algebra of d-sized complex matrices. Then, we adopted a Lie group theoretic approach to create an optimization algorithm for approximating any target unitary matrix using this parametric representation. Consequently, we employed these results to propose a new unitary Hermitian basis for the algebra of 2^n-sized complex matrices, called the Standard Recursive Block Basis which serves as an alternative to the Pauli-string basis. We used this basis to develop an optimization-based approximation algorithm for a scalable quantum neural network representation of a target unitary for n-qubit systems. Additionally, we developed a scalable quantum circuit representation of the exponential of scaled Pauli strings, using which, we have executed circuit simulations of several one-dimensional Hamiltonians on near-term quantum computers, utilizing the first-order Suzuki-Trotter formula. These Hamiltonians include 2-sparse Hamiltonians, Ising Hamiltonians, and  time-independent and time-dependent Random Field Heisenberg Hamiltonians, and Transverse Magnetic Random Field Quantum Ising Hamiltonians. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Further, we introduced discrete-time quantum walk models on cycle graphs, one-dimensional, two-dimensional lattices and Cayley graphs corresponding to Dihedral groups, using parametric coin operators known as generalized Grover coins. Such parameterization was obtained via characterization of orthogonal matrices that are linear sum of permutations i.e. generalization from a combinatorial perspective. We analytically derived the periodicity of these walks and demonstrated through numerical simulations that the walker tends to localize at the initial position for a wide range of parameters of the coin operator, depending on the choice of initial coin states. We then developed qutrit quantum circuit models for simulating three-state discrete-time quantum walk on Cayley graphs defined by Dihedral groups and the additive group of integers modulo a positive integer. These circuit models are scalable and are constructed using elementary qutrit quantum gates, such as single qutrit rotation gates, the qutrit-X gate, and two-qutrit controlled gates.  We also subjected the proposed circuits for Hamiltonian simulations and quantum walks to diverse noise models of varying strengths in order to analyze the circuit performance in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) settings.
